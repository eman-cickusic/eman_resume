        <h2>Projects</h2>
        <p><strong>Intelligent Cloud Operations Agent (LangChain & GCP)</strong><br>
        Python | Terraform | Firestore | BigQuery</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Architected and built a modular AI agent using Python, LangChain’s ReAct framework, and a self-hosted Hugging Face Transformer model (google/flan-t5-base) for advanced Natural Language Processing (NLP) and decision-making.</li>
            <li>Integrated the agent with core GCP services via Python APIs, creating tools to:
                <ul>
                    <li>Manage tasks by performing CRUD operations in a NoSQL database (Firestore).</li>
                    <li>Query live operational data from Cloud Logging and BigQuery.</li>
                    <li>Monitor infrastructure health by fetching real-time data from Cloud Monitoring.</li>
                    <li>Trigger serverless workflows by invoking HTTP-based Cloud Functions.</li>
                </ul>
            </li>
            <li>Enabled Infrastructure-as-Code (IaC) awareness by developing a tool to parse and query Terraform state files (.tfstate) directly from a secure Google Cloud Storage (GCS) bucket.</li>
            <li>Deployed the entire application stack (FastAPI, Gradio UI, LLM) on a GCP Compute Engine VM, meticulously configured with IAM service accounts and VPC firewall rules to ensure secure, zero-cost operation exclusively within the GCP free tier.</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>Work Experience</h2>
        <p><strong>Vodafone</strong>, Remote, Netherlands<br>
        Junior Data Engineer (05/2024–10/2024)</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Designed and optimized serverless, data pipelines on Google Cloud Platform (GCP) using Python, Pandas, and Node.js, Cloud Functions, automating ingestion and transformation of high-volume partner data.</li>
            <li>Provisioned and managed cloud infrastructure as code (IaC) with Terraform, deploying resources like Cloud Storage, BigQuery, Cloud Functions, and IAM policies in a fully repeatable and version-controlled environment.</li>
            <li>Developed a scalable, schema-flexible data processing system (“Smart Sorting Machine”) capable of detecting and transforming multiple file versions into a standardized format; implemented error-handling logic to redirect malformed files for manual inspection.</li>
            <li>Re-architected BigQuery data warehousing strategy, replacing fragmented legacy views with Hive-partitioned external tables, resulting in improved query performance and reduced storage and compute costs.</li>
            <li>Strengthened platform security by migrating hardcoded secrets to Google Secret Manager and enforcing least-privilege IAM roles, aligning with GCP best practices for secure and compliant cloud operations.</li>
        </ul>
